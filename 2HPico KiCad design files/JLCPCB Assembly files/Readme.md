JLCPCB Assembly files for the 2HPico DSP courtesy of Blake #abandonedireland on Youtube

** As of Feb 4/2026 these files are NOT verified**. They look OK to me but Blake has not received and tested his boards yet.

JLCPCB can do SMT assembly of PCBs at relatively low cost. Briefly, the procedure is:

Upload the Gerber files for the PCB

Select PCB assembly and got thru the prompts. It will ask you for a BOM file and a CPL (placement) file - upload these.

It will show you a 3d preview of the assembled board to verify, a detailed cost breakdown of the BOM and the price for the assembled boards.

Note that JLCPCB has a minimum order of 5 boards but the price is very reasonable. I got a quote of $62 USD for 5 assembled boards plus shipping. You will also need to order the front panel PCB and the controls PCBs which will be an additional $10 or so. New JLCPCB customers often get coupons for discounts.
